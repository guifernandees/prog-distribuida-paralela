Elapsed Time: 0.018s
 | Application execution time is too short. Metrics data may be unreliable.
 | Consider reducing the sampling interval or increasing your application
 | execution time.
 |
    IPC: 0.786
     | The IPC may be too low. This could be caused by issues such as memory
     | stalls, instruction starvation, branch misprediction or long latency
     | instructions. Explore the other hardware-related metrics to identify what
     | is causing low IPC.

    Average CPU Frequency: 2.744 GHz 
Effective Logical Core Utilization: 0.2% (0.087 out of 40)
 | The metric value is low, which may signal a poor logical CPU cores
 | utilization. Consider improving physical core utilization as the first step
 | and then look at opportunities to utilize logical cores, which in some cases
 | can improve processor throughput and overall performance of multi-threaded
 | applications.
 |
    Effective Physical Core Utilization: 0.4% (0.087 out of 20)
     | The metric value is low, which may signal a poor physical CPU cores
     | utilization caused by:
     |     - load imbalance
     |     - threading runtime overhead
     |     - contended synchronization
     |     - thread/process underutilization
     |     - incorrect affinity that utilizes logical cores instead of physical
     |       cores
     | Explore sub-metrics to estimate the efficiency of MPI and OpenMP
     | parallelism or run the Locks and Waits analysis to identify parallel
     | bottlenecks for other parallel runtimes.

Microarchitecture Usage: 21.0% of Pipeline Slots
 | You code efficiency on this platform is too low.
 | 
 | Possible cause: memory stalls, instruction starvation, branch misprediction
 | or long latency instructions.
 | 
 | Next steps: Run Microarchitecture Exploration analysis to identify the cause
 | of the low microarchitecture usage efficiency.

    Retiring: 21.0% of Pipeline Slots
    Front-End Bound: 0.0% of Pipeline Slots
    Back-End Bound: 100.0% of Pipeline Slots
     | A significant portion of pipeline slots are remaining empty. When
     | operations take too long in the back-end, they introduce bubbles in the
     | pipeline that ultimately cause fewer pipeline slots containing useful
     | work to be retired per cycle than the machine is capable to support. This
     | opportunity cost results in slower execution. Long-latency operations
     | like divides and memory operations can cause this, as can too many
     | operations being directed to a single execution port (for example, more
     | multiply operations arriving in the back-end per cycle than the execution
     | unit can support).
     |
        Memory Bound: 0.0% of Pipeline Slots
        Core Bound: 100.0% of Pipeline Slots
         | This metric represents how much Core non-memory issues were of a
         | bottleneck. Shortage in hardware compute resources, or dependencies
         | software's instructions are both categorized under Core Bound. Hence
         | it may indicate the machine ran out of an OOO resources, certain
         | execution units are overloaded or dependencies in program's data- or
         | instruction- flow are limiting the performance (e.g. FP-chained long-
         | latency arithmetic operations).

Recommendations:
    Increase execution time:  
     | Application execution time is too short. Metrics data may be unreliable.
     | Consider reducing the sampling interval or increasing your application
     | execution time.
    Hotspots: Start with Hotspots analysis to understand the efficiency of your algorithm.
     | Use Hotspots analysis to identify the most time consuming functions.
     | Drill down to see the time spent on every line of code.
    Threading: There is poor utilization of logical CPU cores (0.2%) in your application. 
     |  Use Threading to explore more opportunities to increase parallelism in
     | your application.
    Microarchitecture Exploration: There is low microarchitecture usage (21.0%) of available hardware resources. 
     | Run Microarchitecture Exploration analysis to analyze CPU
     | microarchitecture bottlenecks that can affect application performance.
